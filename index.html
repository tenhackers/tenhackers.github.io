          <summary>Who are we?</summary>
          <div>We are a small group of self-employed software engineers based in the US, each with 15+ years of professional experience in enterprise software for various companies. We taught ourselves how to code as kids, and we love to solve problems, build & fix things, and just knock out code. We don't love sitting in meetings all day.</div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What are our strengths?</summary>
          <div>Most of our technical experience revolves around server-side and data architecture & engineering. Even though we don't have much experience in embedded systems, mobile development, and game development, we would invite the opportunity to work in those areas.</div>
        </details>
